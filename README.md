# blitz
blitz is (supposed to be) a 3D game engine. It's name comes from the fact, that is supposed to be fast, as the german offensive.

# Installation
blitz has a few 3rd party dependencies, like the 3d math library, or cross-platform window/input layer, which are defined as git submodules.

To install all the above dependencies, run:
```

```
